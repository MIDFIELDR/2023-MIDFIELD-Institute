In the second session we illustrate a repertoire of chart types and how they are suited to specific data structures and answering specific types of questions.

The session should encourage you to: 

- Explicitly define the type of **variables** in your data
- Suit the chart **design** to the variables you have 
- Iteratively explore the **message** conveyed by different designs

**Materials**

- [Download PDF](https://github.com/graphdr/workshop-data-stories/blob/main/slides/chart-repertoire-handout.pdf) worksheets for think-write-share activities. Hard copy seems to work best for many people.
