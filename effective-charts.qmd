Our goals in visual rhetoric are  
  
- Improving **perception** of stories in the data
- Facilitating quantitative **reasoning** about the data
- Enhancing **credibility** of evidence supporting an argument

**Materials**

- [Download PDF](https://github.com/graphdr/workshop-data-stories/blob/main/slides/effective-charts-handout.pdf) worksheets for think-write-share activities. Hardcopy seems to work best for many people.
