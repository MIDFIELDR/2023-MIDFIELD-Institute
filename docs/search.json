    "text": "Preface\nThe rationale for using the ggplot2 package instead of other R graphics environments (e.g., lattice, base R, or grid graphics) is nicely summarized by Zumel and Mount—it “excels at combining multiple graphical elements together” even though “its syntax can take some getting used to” (Zumel & Mount, 2020, p. 60). They raise three key points:\n\nGraphs in ggplot2 are defined only on data frames. The variables from the data frame—assigned to the x-axis, the y-axis, or to the color or size of a data marker—are called aesthetics, declared using the aes() function.\nThe ggplot() function declares the graph object; its arguments can include the data frame of interest and the aesthetics. The ggplot() function doesn’t itself produce a visualization; visualizations are produced by layers.\nLayers produce the plots and plot transformations and are added to a graph object using the + operator. Each layer can also take a data frame and aesthetics as arguments, in addition to layer-specific parameters. Example of layers are geom_point() for a scatterplot and geom_line() for a line plot.\n\nBefore starting.

    "section": "Data",
    "text": "Data\nIntroduction. R comes with many datasets installed. We’ll use the ChickWeight data set to cover some basic data manipulation to prepare the data for graphing.\nThe help page for ChickWeight summarizes the experiment from which the data were collected,\n\nThe body weights of the chicks were measured at birth and every second day thereafter until day 20. They were also measured on day 21. There were four groups of chicks on different protein diets.”\n\nYou can view the help page by running,\nhelp(\"ChickWeight\")\nThere are 578 observations (rows) and 4 variables (columns). Recall that names are case-sensitive—weight is lowercase, the other variables are capitalized.\n\nChick: unique ID for each chick.\nDiet: one of four protein diets.\nTime: number of days since birth.\nweight: body weight of chick in grams.\n\nThe goal of graphing the data is to investigate the effect of diet on weight over time.\nDownload and save a CSV file. We use the data.table fread() function to read the data set from the workshop repository (an Internet connection is required).\nWe use fwrite() to save the file to the data directory in your project folder.\n# data URL\ndata_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIDFIELDR/2023-midfield-institute/main/data/chick_weight.csv\"\n\n# download the data\nchick_weight <- fread(data_url)\n\n# write the data to your data directory\nfwrite(chick_weight, \"data/chick_weight.csv\")\nThese lines of code are run only once. After the data are downloaded, these lines can be commented out, e.g.,\n\n# # data URL\n# data_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIDFIELDR/2023-midfield-institute/main/data/chick_weight.csv\"\n# \n# # download the data\n# chick_weight <- fread(data_url)\n# \n# # write the data to your data directory\n# fwrite(chick_weight, \"data/chick_weight.csv\")\n\nImport a CSV file. We import the data from the local file chick_weight.csv using fread(). This function returns a data.table object. A data.table is a data.frame with additional attributes.\n\ncw <- fread(\"data/chick_weight.csv\")\n\nLook at the data. To look at the data, type the object (dataset) name:\n\n# view the data\ncw\n#>      Chick  Diet  Time weight\n#>      <int> <int> <int>  <int>\n#>   1:    18     1     0     39\n#>   2:    18     1     2     35\n#>   3:    16     1     0     41\n#>   4:    16     1     2     45\n#>   5:    16     1     4     49\n#>  ---                         \n#> 574:    48     4    14    170\n#> 575:    48     4    16    222\n#> 576:    48     4    18    261\n#> 577:    48     4    20    303\n#> 578:    48     4    21    322\n\nSeveral base R functions help us inspect the data.

It is only an introduction to what R can do but hopefully you have seen some of the potential of using R for data science.\nNext steps. There are plenty of R courses, books, and online resources that you can learn from. Find things that work for you and don’t be afraid to make mistakes or ask questions.\nDuring the MIDFIELD workshops, you will build on what you’ve learned here, and use the midfieldr package to study student unit records. You can preview that material on the midfieldr website."

For example, try the following two commands (which give the same result):\n# view the function help page\nhelp(mean)\n? mean\nKeyword search. To do a keyword search use the function apropos() with the keyword in double quotes (“keyword”) or single quote (‘keyword’). For example:\n\n# keyword search \napropos(\"mean\")\n#>  [1] \".colMeans\"     \".rowMeans\"     \"colMeans\"      \"kmeans\"       \n#>  [5] \"mean\"          \"mean.Date\"     \"mean.default\"  \"mean.difftime\"\n#>  [9] \"mean.POSIXct\"  \"mean.POSIXlt\"  \"rowMeans\"      \"weighted.mean\"\n\nThe lines of R output are labeled—here with [1], [5] , and [9]. These labels indicate the index or position of the first element in that line within the overall output (here, of length 12). Thus in this output vector, \".colMeans\" has index 1, \"mean\" has index 5, and \"mean.POSIXct\" has index 9.\nHelp examples. Use the example() function to run the examples at the end of the help for a function:\n\n# run the examples at the end of the help page\nexample(mean)\n#> \n#> mean> x <- c(0:10, 50)\n#> \n#> mean> xm <- mean(x)\n#> \n#> mean> c(xm, mean(x, trim = 0.10))\n#> [1] 8.75 5.50\n\nHere, the output of the mean() example has length 2 (8.75 5.50). The label [1] indicates that the number 8.75 has index 1.\nRStudio help. Rstudio provides search box in the Help tab to make your life easier (see Figure 1).\nOnline help. When you search online use [r] in your search terms, for example, “[r] linear regression”. Because we use data.table for data manipulation, I further recommend that you include data.table as a keyword, e.g., “[r][data.table] group and summarize”.\nThere is nearly always more than one solution to your problem—investigate the different options and try to use one whose arguments and logic you can follow. Limiting your browser’s search to the past year can sometimes eliminate out-of-date solutions.\n\nYour turnAnswer\n\n\nTry the following.\n\nhelp(median)\n? sd\n? max\n\n\n\nThe following help pages should appear in the RStudio Help pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning. If an R command is not complete then R will show a plus sign (+) prompt on second and subsequent lines until the command syntax is correct.\n+ \nPress the escape key (ESC) to break out.\nHint. To recall a previous command, put your cursor in the Console and use the up arrow key (↑). To go between previously typed commands use the up and down arrow (↓) keys. To modify or correct a command use the left (←) and right arrow (→) keys."

The objects presented so far have been scalars (single values). Working with vectors is where R shines best as they are the basic building blocks of datasets.\nWe can create a vector using the c() (combine values into a vector) function.\n\n# a numeric vector\nx1 <- c(26, 10, 4, 7, 41, 19)\n\n# view\nx1\n#> [1] 26 10  4  7 41 19\n\n# a character vector\nx2 <- c(\"Peru\", \"Italy\", \"Cuba\", \"Ghana\")\n\n# view\nx2\n#> [1] \"Peru\"  \"Italy\" \"Cuba\"  \"Ghana\"\n\nThere are many other ways to create vectors, for example, rep() (replicate elements) and seq() (create sequences):\n\n# repeat vector (2, 6, 7, 4) three times\nr1 <- rep(c(2, 6, 7, 4), times = 3)\n\n# view\nr1\n#>  [1] 2 6 7 4 2 6 7 4 2 6 7 4\n\n\n# vector from -2 to 3 incremented by 0.5\ns1 <- seq(from = -2, to = 3, by = 0.5)\n\n# view\ns1\n#>  [1] -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0\n\nVector operations. You can do calculations on vectors, for example using x1 from above:\n\n# multiply every element by 2\nx1 * 2\n#> [1] 52 20  8 14 82 38\n\n# operation order: product, root, then round\nround(sqrt(x1 * 2.6), 2)\n#> [1]  8.22  5.10  3.22  4.27 10.32  7.03\n\nMissing values.

For example, we could use the argument length.out (instead of by) to fix the length of the sequence as follows:\n\n# replacing `by` with `length.out` \nseq(from = 5, to = 8, length.out = 16)\n#>  [1] 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0\n\nCustom functions. As you gain familiarity with R, you may want to learn how to construct your own custom functions, but that’s not an objective of our “basics” tutorials.\nR packages. The basic R installation comes with over 2000 functions, but R can be extended further using contributed packages. Packages are like “apps” for R, containing functions, data, and documentation.\nTo see a list of functions and data sets bundled in a package, use the ls() function, e,g,\n\nls(\"package:midfieldr\")\n#>  [1] \"add_completion_status\" \"add_data_sufficiency\"  \"add_timely_term\"      \n#>  [4] \"baseline_mcid\"         \"cip\"                   \"filter_cip\"           \n#>  [7] \"fye_proxy\"             \"order_multiway\"        \"prep_fye_mice\"        \n#> [10] \"same_content\"          \"select_required\"       \"study_observations\"   \n#> [13] \"study_programs\"        \"study_results\"         \"toy_course\"           \n#> [16] \"toy_degree\"            \"toy_student\"           \"toy_term\"\n\nAlternatively, in RStudio select the Packages tab and in its menu bar type the package name in the search box. In the pane, click on the package name. A help page opens listing all the functions and names of data sets in the package, e.g.,\n\nIn MIDFIELD work, we use a small number of R packages:\n\nmidfieldr for tools to study student unit records\nmidfielddata for practice data\ndata.table for manipulating data\nggplot2 for charts"

All values in a column are of the same type (numerical, character, logical, etc.) but columns can be of different types.\nFor example, the data frame study_results that is bundled with midfieldr has three character columns and three numerical columns.\n\n# a data frame bundled with midfieldr\nstudy_results\n#>     program    sex            race ever_enrolled graduates stickiness\n#>  1:      CE Female           Asian            15        10       66.7\n#>  2:      CE Female           Black             4         1       25.0\n#>  3:      CE Female   International            23        13       56.5\n#>  4:      CE Female          Latine            13         6       46.2\n#>  5:      CE Female Native American             1         1      100.0\n#>  6:      CE Female   Other/Unknown             5         3       60.0\n#>  7:      CE Female           White           263       162       61.6\n#>  8:      CE   Male           Asian            30        25       83.3\n#>  9:      CE   Male           Black             8         5       62.5\n#> 10:      CE   Male   International            97        55       56.7\n#> 11:      CE   Male          Latine            66        31       47.0\n#> 12:      CE   Male Native American             3         1       33.3\n#> 13:      CE   Male   Other/Unknown            27        11       40.7\n#> 14:      CE   Male           White           949       612       64.5\n#> 15:      EE Female           Asian            21        12       57.1\n#> 16:      EE Female           Black             6         3       50.0\n#> 17:      EE Female   International            28         9       32.1\n#> 18:      EE Female          Latine             8         3       37.5\n#> 19:      EE Female Native American             1         0        0.0\n#> 20:      EE Female   Other/Unknown             7         3       42.9\n#> 21:      EE Female           White           118        56       47.5\n#> 22:      EE   Male           Asian           123        71       57.7\n#> 23:      EE   Male           Black            29        17       58.6\n#> 24:      EE   Male   International           195        90       46.2\n#> 25:      EE   Male          Latine            45        17       37.8\n#> 26:      EE   Male Native American             3         0        0.0\n#> 27:      EE   Male   Other/Unknown            42        16       38.1\n#> 28:      EE   Male           White           864       439       50.8\n#> 29:     ISE Female           Asian            15        10       66.7\n#> 30:     ISE Female           Black             7         6       85.7\n#> 31:     ISE Female   International             6         2       33.3\n#> 32:     ISE Female           White            77        54       70.1\n#> 33:     ISE   Male           Asian            24        14       58.3\n#> 34:     ISE   Male           Black             9         6       66.7\n#> 35:     ISE   Male   International            22        12       54.5\n#> 36:     ISE   Male          Latine             6         4       66.7\n#> 37:     ISE   Male           White           187       130       69.5\n#> 38:      ME Female           Asian             7         1       14.3\n#> 39:      ME Female           Black             3         2       66.7\n#> 40:      ME Female   International            19        11       57.9\n#> 41:      ME Female          Latine            12         8       66.7\n#> 42:      ME Female   Other/Unknown             8         4       50.0\n#> 43:      ME Female           White           213       134       62.9\n#> 44:      ME   Male           Asian            76        49       64.5\n#> 45:      ME   Male           Black            30        19       63.3\n#> 46:      ME   Male   International           178        89       50.0\n#> 47:      ME   Male          Latine            79        42       53.2\n#> 48:      ME   Male Native American             5         1       20.0\n#> 49:      ME   Male   Other/Unknown            80        41       51.2\n#> 50:      ME   Male           White          1596       953       59.7\n#>     program    sex            race ever_enrolled graduates stickiness\n\nclass(study_results)\n#> [1] \"data.table\" \"data.frame\"\n\nThe class() function reveals that this data.frame object is also a data.table object, which is an enhanced version of R’s standard data frame.\n\nYour turnAnswer\n\n\nFor the following midfieldr objects, determine:\n\nthe class ofadd_timely_term\nthe class oftoy_student\nthe names of the variables in toy_term\n\n\n\n# class of add_timely_term\n#> [1] \"function\"\n\n# class of toy_student\n#> [1] \"data.table\" \"data.frame\"\n\n# variables in toy_term\n#> [1] \"mcid\" \"institution\" \"term\" \"cip6\" \"level\" \"hours_term\" \n\n\n\nEverything in R has structure\n\nstr(room_area)  #
