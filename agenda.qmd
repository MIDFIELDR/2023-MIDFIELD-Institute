## Pre-workshop

**Pre-workshop tutorials**     
If you are new to R (or new to the ggplot2 or data.table packages), we recommend you complete the three introductory tutorials listed below. Completing these tutorials before attending the Institute will make your time with us that much more productive. The tutorials are designed for the R novice. 

- [R basics](r-basics.html)   
- [Chart basics](chart-basics.html)
- [Data basics](data-basics.html)

**Daily wrap-up.**    
*Before 5:00*    
Please check in with us before leaving the virtual meeting.





**Homework**

- Complete the guided practice [Case study: Data](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-002-case-data.html) tutorial.

## Thursday, July 13

[Join the online meeting](https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/j/99534954101?pwd=QkZ3SlpDZyszVVZDQkU4ZWR5TjMwdz09)

*1:00--1:30 Eastern Time*    
Pipelines, pathways, and ecosystems. 




**Guided practice**    
*1:30--2:30*    
Conclude the case study. Real-time help.     

- [Case study part 3: Results](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-003-case-results.html) Group and summarize the observations you saved previously, calculate a metric, and display the results.




**Creating more effective charts** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/placeholder.pdf) [![](resources/download-icon.png) worksheets](resources/2023-effective-charts-handout.pdf)    
*2:30--3:30*    
Data visualization session 1. Download the worksheets for our think-pair-share activities. We will ask you to write answers to prompts, so we recommend a hard-copy printout. 

We demonstrate the perceptual limitations of common graph types and suggest more effective alternatives. Our goals in visual rhetoric are

- Improving *perception* of stories in the data  
- Facilitating quantitative *reasoning* about the data  
- Enhancing *credibility* of evidence supporting an argument  

 



**Drafting a research question.** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/placeholder-image.pdf)    
*3:30--5:00*    
Define a problem in the data that interests you with our assistance, form small groups. Report out your research questions and discussion. 


- [Data dictionaries](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/index.html) for the four practice data sets. 
- [Exploring the variables](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-000-getting-started.html) using R. The midfieldr "Getting started" page illustrates how to examine possible values for a variable.  



**Daily wrap-up.**    
*Before 5:00*    
Please check in with us before leaving the virtual meeting.





**Homework**

- Complete the guided practice [Case study: Results](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-003-case-results.html) tutorial. 
- Refine your plan for working on your research question.  
- *Optional (FYI)*. Topics from today's guided practice are developed in greater detail in midfieldr package vignettes  [[link]](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/).






## Friday, July 14

[Join the online meeting](https://purdue-edu.zoom.us/j/99534954101?pwd=QkZ3SlpDZyszVVZDQkU4ZWR5TjMwdz09)     





**Expanding your graphical repertoire** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/placeholder-image.pdf) [![](resources/download-icon.png) worksheets](resources/2023-chart-repertoire-handout.pdf)        
*1:00--2:00 Eastern Time*    
Data visualization session 2. Download the worksheets for our think-pair-share activities. We will ask you to write answers to prompts, so we recommend a hard-copy printout. 

We illustrate a repertoire of chart types and how they are suited to specific data structures and answering specific types of questions. The session should encourage you to:

- Explicitly define the type of *variables* in your data
- Suit the chart *design* to the variables you have
- Iteratively explore the *message* conveyed by different designs





**Work on your research question** [![](resources/download-icon.png) guidelines](resources/2023-draft-a-research-question.pdf)    
*2:00--3:30*    
Consult with us on your progress, discussion 




**Progress report**    
*3:30--4:30*
