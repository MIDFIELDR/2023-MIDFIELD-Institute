## Pre-workshop




**Pre-workshop tutorials**     
If you are new to R (or new to the ggplot2 or data.table packages), we recommend you complete the three introductory tutorials listed below. Completing these tutorials before attending the Institute will make your time with us that much more productive.

- [R basics](r-basics.html)   
- [R chart basics](chart-basics.html)
- [R data basics](data-basics.html)

**Metaphors and metrics** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/2023-metaphors-and-metrics.pdf)   
*1:00--1:30 Eastern Time*    
Pipelines, pathways, and ecosystems. 




**Guided practice**    
*1:30--2:30*    
[Case study: Results](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-003-case-results.html) Continue the case study.

*2:30--3:30*    
A hard-copy printout of the worksheet is recommended for our think-share activities. We demonstrate the perceptual limitations of common graph types and suggest more effective alternatives. Our goals in visual rhetoric are  
  
- Improving **perception** of stories in the data
- Facilitating quantitative **reasoning** about the data
- Enhancing **credibility** of evidence supporting an argument
 




**Drafting a research question.** [![](resources/download-icon.png) slides](resources/2023-research-question.pdf)   
*3:30--5:00*    
Define a problem in the data that interests you with our assistance, form small groups. Report out your research questions and discussion. Please check in with us before leaving the virtual meeting. 

- [Data dictionaries](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/index.html) for the four practice data sets. 
- [Exploring the variables](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-000-getting-started.html) using R. The midfieldr "Getting started" page illustrates how to examine possible values for a variable.  




**Homework**

- Complete the guided practice "Results" tutorial. 
- Refine your plan for working on your research question.
