Very useful if you are familiar with dplyr syntax and want to translate that familiar functionality to data.table syntax. \n\n- @R-data.table-website for the data.table website with vignettes by the package authors \n\n- @R-ggplot2-gallery for a gallery of chart designs possible with ggplot2.\n\n- @Layton:2022 for Richard's blog in which several articles illustrate redesigning a published chart in an engineering education article to better align the logic of a display with the logic of the argument. \n\n- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a searchable aggregator of R blogs.\n\n- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) Searchable, public platform for coding questions and answers. For R-specific Q&A, add `[r]` as a search tag. Additional search tags such as `[ggplot2]` or `[data.table]` will help narrow your searches involving these packages. \n\n- @R-rstudio-cheatsheets Links to downloadable help summaries (cheat sheets) for ggplot2 and many other packages. For data.table scroll down to the \"Contributed cheatsheets\" section. \n\n- @Zumel+Mount:2020 for data science work with a very good chapter on data manipulation that performs every step three ways: a base R solution,  a data.table solution, and a dplyr solution. \n\n\n\n\n## Non-R (no code)\n\n- @Mount+Zumel:2019:fluid-data for a *theory of coordinatized data*, that is, converting to and from row-oriented and column-oriented data structures (commonly called pivoting and unpivoting).\n\n- @Robbins:2013 for a detailed development of principles and practices for creating effective charts.  \n\n\n## References\n",
