It's one thing to read or hear about Midfield in the wild, but you don't really get a handle on things that way.  It's also nice to have the MF team in situ because they can say, ""Yes, and..."" and ""No, because...""  "

Also having time to work during the workshop helped so we could ask questions and get help right when we needed it. The presenters were excellent. I liked hearing the ""how-to"" parts about MIDFIELD and R and then also hearing examples of successful research papers that used the MIDFIELD data. And I will always remember the graph/chart presentations from Richard. My new favorite quote is the one from Edward Tufte about accessing the subtle and the difficult and ""the revelation of the complex!"" Thank you all for a great workshop! I may be in administration now, but I still love to learn. Perhaps Matt could let us know when other MIDFIELD workshops will be held, or if it is posted on a MIDFIELD website. I have colleagues that I think would really gain a lot from the workshop. One was on vacation this week and the other two never found out about it. I just learned about it through ASEE. I should have asked if other participants had learned about the workshop in other ways. I also think the workshop worked very well (or was designed to work very well!) in an online format."
